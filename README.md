# graphing-calculator

At the end of the project, the graphing calculator will be able to perform following functions:
1) Graph ANY polynomial rational expression, with removable discontinuities clearly highlighted. 
2) Graph ANY polynomial function, and its first and second derivatives; use various colored lines and markers to find points of relative max/min, and points of inflection.         
3) For any logarithmic, trigonometric, or exponential  function, implement the same graphing as 2)           
4) Given any fâ€™(x) accurately show the fundamental theorem of calculus for any two values on the
given domain.
